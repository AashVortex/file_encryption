## File Encryption Tool
A Python-based file encryption and decryption tool designed to protect sensitive digital data using modern cryptographic techniques. The tool uses the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm from the Python Cryptography Project library to ensure strong data confidentiality and integrity.

The application runs through a Command Line Interface (CLI) and allows users to securely encrypt files, generate encryption keys automatically, and decrypt files when needed.

## objective 
• Develop a secure file encryption system to protect sensitive digital data
• Implement symmetric encryption using the Fernet algorithm
• Automatically generate and manage encryption keys
• Provide a simple CLI-based interface for encrypting and decrypting files
• Ensure confidentiality and integrity of stored files
